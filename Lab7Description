(50 points) Using Example 12.1 in the Hohl and Hinds textbook as a guide, perform the following, using read-only data robot_type, scale_factor, and radius and three
lookup tables orientation, o_angle, and reference.  Assume that each data item is a word-sized unsigned integer.  Store the output(s) in words distance and angle in 
memory.

If robot_type = 1:	This is an orientation robot.  Load an element with index scale_factor from table orientation.  Multiply this by radius and store the result in 
distance. Load an element with index scale_factor from table o_angle, then store this in angle.

If robot_type = 2:	This is a reference robot.  Load an element with index scale_factor from table reference.  Multiply this by radius and store the result in distance.  
Store –1 in angle.

Else:	Do nothing.

Create your own tables orientation, o_angle, and reference.  Each should contain at least 5 elements. You will be given test data during lab time for which your code 
must work to receive credit.

When running your code on the test data, determine the execution time of your program as follows.  In the debugger, click on the debug tab and then select Execution 
Profiling/Show Time.  When you execute the program, the window showing your program will show the execution time of each instruction executed.  
(If a particular instruction is executed multiple times, then the execution time shown adds up all of those executions.)  Add those times to determine the execution 
time of your program.  (Ignore the time at the “stop b stop” line.)  Do this for each set of test data.  Include these times in your report.
